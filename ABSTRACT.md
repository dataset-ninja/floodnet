### Track 1

In this track, participants are required to complete two semi-supervised tasks. The first task is image classification, and the second task is semantic segmentation.

1. Semi-Supervised Classification: Classification for FloodNet dataset requires classifying the images into ‘Flooded’ and ‘Non-Flooded’ classes. Only a few of the training images have their labels available, while most of the training images are unlabeled.
2. Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation: The semantic segmentation labels include: 1) Background, 2) Building Flooded, 3) Building Non-Flooded, 4) Road Flooded, 5) Road Non-Flooded, 6) Water, 7)Tree, 8) Vehicle, 9) Pool, 10) Grass. Only a small portion of the training images have their corresponding masks available.
