**FloodNet 2021: A High Resolution Aerial Imagery Dataset for Post Flood Scene Understanding (Track 1)** is a dataset for semantic segmentation, classification, and semi supervised learning tasks. It is used in the search and rescue (SAR) and environmental industries. 

The dataset consists of 2343 images with 1517 labeled objects belonging to 10 different classes including *grass*, *tree*, *road non-flooded*, and other: *water*, *building non-flooded*, *vehicle*, *pool*, *road flooded*, *building flooded*, and *background*.

Images in the FloodNet 2021: Track 1 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 1945 (83% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (1445 images), *validation* (450 images), and *test* (448 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 semi-supervised classification sets: ***non-flooded*** (347 images) and ***flooded*** (51 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">UMBC, USA</span>, <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Texas A&M University</span>, and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Dewberry, USA</span>.
